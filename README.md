## Let's Git it on
#### Download and install Git
This is a large file, so hopefully you've already done this. If not, try grabbing it from someone who has via "Air Drop". Probably faster than downloading from the interwebs.

#### Download and install Github Mac Client
This is optional and you can do everything from the command line using the `git` command, but some people prefer using a visual client. It doesn't hurt to have it.
```
https://desktop.github.com/
```

## Terminal Stuffs

#### Install iTerm2
OSX has a built in Terminal/Command line app, but it's not as nice as iTerm. So download & install it. You'll be very happy you did.
```
https://www.iterm2.com/
```
Make sure you drag the application icon from your "Downloads" folder to your "Applications" folder on your Mac. If you don't know what that means or how to do that, ask one of the nerds in the room.

You may also want to "Keep in Dock" the iTerm app, so that its always there and easily accessible.

#### Zsh is good for you
```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

#### Make command line useful & pretty
